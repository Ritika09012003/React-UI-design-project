Customer Segmentation UI (React + TailwindCSS)

A simple static UI design built using React (Vite) and TailwindCSS.
This project recreates a clean “Prospective Customer Segmentation” section with three cards, inspired by modern digital banking designs.
The UI has no hover effects, no interactivity — it focuses only on layout and appearance.
